For a **Point of Sale (POS) system**, the key accounts needed revolve around **inventory management, sales transactions, purchases, and cash handling**. Here’s a streamlined list of the most relevant accounts, grouped by function:

---

### **Essential Accounts for a POS System**  

#### **1. Inventory & Purchases (Goods In)**  
- **Inventory** (Non-Fixed Assets) → Tracks products for sale.  
- **Accounts Payable** (Current Liabilities) → Money owed to suppliers.  
- **Purchases** (Operating Expenses) → Cost of goods bought (if not using COGS directly).  
- **Cash** (Non-Fixed Assets) → If paying suppliers immediately.  

#### **2. Sales & Revenue (Goods Out)**  
- **Sale Revenue** (Operating Revenues) → Income from product sales.  
- **Accounts Receivable** (Non-Fixed Assets) → If selling on credit.  
- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** (Operating Expenses) → Direct cost of sold inventory *(not listed earlier but critical for POS)*.  

#### **3. Cash Handling**  
- **Cash** (Non-Fixed Assets) → Physical money or digital payments.  
- **Credit Card Receivables** (Non-Fixed Assets) → Pending card payments *(if applicable)*.  

#### **4. Operating Expenses (Behind-the-Scenes Costs)**  
- **Supplies Expense** (Operating Expenses) → POS consumables (receipt paper, bags).  
- **Rent** (Operating Expenses) → If operating in a physical store.  
- **Salaries** (Operating Expenses) → Staff wages.  

#### **5. Liabilities from Sales**  
- **Sales Tax Payable** (Current Liabilities) → Taxes collected from customers.  
- **Unearned Revenue** (Current Liabilities) → Gift cards/store credit.  

---

### **Accounts You Can Likely Ignore (For Basic POS)**  
- Fixed Assets (Equipment, Buildings) → Unless tracking POS hardware separately.  
- Long-Term Liabilities (Bonds, Loans) → Not day-to-day POS concerns.  
- Non-Operating Items (Interest, Investments) → Irrelevant to core sales/purchases.  

---

### **Simplified POS Accounting Flow**  
1. **Purchase Goods**:  
   - Debit **Inventory**, Credit **Accounts Payable** (or **Cash** if paid upfront).  
2. **Sell Goods**:  
   - Debit **Cash** (or **Accounts Receivable**), Credit **Sale Revenue**.  
   - Debit **COGS**, Credit **Inventory** (to reduce stock).  
3. **Pay Expenses**:  
   - Debit **Rent/Supplies Expense**, Credit **Cash**.
